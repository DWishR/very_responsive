# The Very Responsive Engine

### Intent

The goal of this project is to create a modern engine that is framerate first
rather than fidelity first. This will be paramount as we transition into
virtual worlds. To this end, the engine must become largely self-aware: timing
sections of code, observing object counts, monitoring gpu utilization,
understanding updates and their interdependencies, and capable of cutting off or
spreading out work that cannot fit within a frame.
